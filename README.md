# This Repository Contains a Solution for the Following Homework

## A/B Testing 

### Scenario

You have four advertisement options (bandits), and your task is to design an experiment using Epsilon Greedy and Thompson Sampling.

### Design of Experiment

A bandit class has already been created for you. It is an abstract class with abstract methods. You must not exclude anything from the Bandit() class. However, you can add **more stuff if you need**

* Bandit_Reward=[1,2,3,4] 
* NumberOfTrials: 20000

**1. Create a Bandit Class**

**2. Create EpsilonGreedy() and ThompsonSampling() classes and methods (inherited from Bandit()).**

  **2.1. Epsilon-greedy:**
     
    1. decay epsilon by 1/t
    
    2. design the experiment 
    
  **2.2. Thompson Sampling**
    
    1. design with known precision 
    
    2. design the experiment

**3. Report:**

    1. Visualize the learning process for each algorithm (plot1())
    
    2. Visualize cumulative rewards from E-Greedy and Thompson Sampling. 
    
    3. Store the rewards in a CSV file ({Bandit, Reward, Algorithm})
    
    4. Print cumulative reward
    
    5. Print cumulative regret


Note the values of *epsilon* and *precision* are up to you to decide.


### Submission

    1. The code must be well documented, I’d recommend using pyment package
       
    2. We will not continue checking after the error message (regardless of the error).
    
    3. Late submissions will be treated according to the rules written in the syllabus.
    
    4. Push the codes to GitHub and submit only the link of a repo to Moodle.
